# linear-regression-analysis
A comprehensive study on linear and nonlinear regression methods, focusing on numerical stability, collinearity effects, and optimization approaches. This project compares Normal Equations, SVD, BGD, and SGD on synthetic datasets and evaluates how model complexity and numerical conditioning influence performance and stability.
